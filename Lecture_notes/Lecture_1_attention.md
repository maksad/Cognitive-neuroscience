# Lecture 1: Attention

### Intro
* Relatively new discipline
* Early attempt of cognitive neuroscience, influenced by "phrenology" - pseudoscience that assigns various location (bumps) on the scull that are related to various parts of the brain
* Neurotypical (NT) a subject whose autistic "score" or autistic features is below certain threshold

### Importance of NS
* Application areas:
    * refines theoretical and experimental basis for clinical research. Coming with better treatments
    * algorithms for AI/robotics and etc.
    * helps developing of man-machine interface

### Attention
* William James: one of the pioneers of psychology and influential figure in neuroscience.
* facets of attention:
    * involuntary attention
        - how stimuli and outside of the "spotlight of attention" are processed by the brain
    * selective attention
        - how long can one choose out of stimuli, the most task-relevant ones
        - visual and auditory information directed to a specific target increases selective attention with high signal to noise ratio (SNR)
        - "convert attention": without moving the gaze one can selectively attend parts of one's visual field (eg. animals move their ears)
    * unselective/alertness attention
        - detection mode (eg. fight or flight mode)
    * divided attention
        - (eg. speaking on phone while listening on the phone)
    * sustained attention
        - ability to concentrate over a minute or hours
    * shifting of attention
        - switching attention: move attention from one target to another. Eg. patients with parkinson disease can't switch their attention
* attention is not limited to external stimuli, but also internal. Eg. calculating, planning and etc.


### Behavior methods: dichotic listening task
* Eg. two source of audio coming to person (left and right ear) and the person choses to direct their attention to one source.
* Measurement of eye movement, "the heatmap", gives information about emotions, intensions, ques and etc.
* factors guiding visual search:
    * bottom up stimulus driven guidance
        - pattern recognition and similarities between various objects
    * top-down
        - searched based on colour, motion, orientation, size, shape and etc.
    * scene guidance based on some features
        - eg. dalmatian dog in pattern of randomly distributed shapes
    * guidance based on history previous search
        - eg. a scene with various objects and a person is looking for human or bird

### Disturbances of attention in neurological patients
* Unilateral neglect: subjects who do not have perception of their left side. It happens in the right hemisphere, which is dominant in perceptual understanding of the entire space. Depending on the lesion different side-effect might happen.
* apperceptive agnosia: inability to copy, recognize or match visual stimuli
* visual object agnosia: inability to name or demonstrate use of objects.
* prosopagnosia: not being able to recognize who is the person, or own dog. Can perform generic object recognition, but not specific
* color agnosia
* simultanagnosia: difficult to see more than one object at a time
* metamorphopsia: object can be identified, but their shape and size might be distorted
* auditory agnosia: eg. can't recognize familiar voices or nature voices
* tactile agnosia: primary sensory cortical lesions.
