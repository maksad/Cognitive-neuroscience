### What did I learn today?
My background is mainly computer science, thus majority of presented material is new for me. I found it very interesting and at the same time challenging to grasp everything, as most of the scientific jargon and terminology is new for me. After this lecture I have learned about main ideas behind cognitive neuroscience, methods of cognitive neuroscience and attention. Prior to this class I thought of attention as directed focus and never really dug into other aspects of it. Specifically, involuntary, selective, alertness attention and etc. This lecture did clarify many forms of attention and complementing each category with clinical examples.

### What was surprising?
The surprising aspects of the lecture and reading materials were the sections about disturbances of attention in neurological patients with various agnosia. One specific topic that caught my attention was unilateral neglect, where patients loose the perception of space on their left side.

### What did I not understand?
Some topics that I did not intuitively understand were quantification of auditory cortex, analysis of selective attention and subcortical effects. These topics are new to me, hence I found them a bit challenging to comprehend.

### Question to the teacher:
Would it be possible to move the lecture to 9:00? At the moment it overlaps with another course.
